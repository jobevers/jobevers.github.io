I'd like to create a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies. But
there are a million different alt-coins out there; some of them are
doing interesting things, some of them are garbage. This is the start
of my slow, systematic attempt at trying to figure out which is which.

I'm going to work my way down the list of coins / tokens according to
their market cap, which is tracked by these two sites:
 * [https://www.livecoinwatch.com/](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/)
 * [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

I'm hoping to get a sense of:
 * what is technically interesting about the coin,
 * what sort of adoption it has
 * how is it minined and who is mining it
